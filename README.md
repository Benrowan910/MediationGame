# Godot Engine
To ensure stability across all collaboraters, we will be using Godot Version #$$$$ in order to work on this project.

  ## why godot?
  Godot offers an extremely slick user experience when working on games, especially 2D.
  Godot is an open source, and free available engine. Meaning we have creative freedom over our project.
  Godot is an up-and-coming engine. Learning it's interface and features from an engineering standpoint will be incredibly useful in the future.
